Warface is a free-to-play online first-person shooter game developed by Crytek Kiev, co-produced by Crytek Seoul, and published by My.com.
The game was developed with Crytek's in-house CryEngine V. Following the free-to-play model, Warface centers around online firefights in PvP matches, with microtransactions allowing players to purchase weapons, equipment, and cosmetic gear.
The Xbox 360 port, which was developed by Crytek UK, was discontinued in February 2015. The console version of the game was relaunched for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in 2018.
Members of the game's development team split from Crytek Kiev in February 2019 to form a new development studio, Blackwood Games, who will handle future development duties for <b>Warface</b>
